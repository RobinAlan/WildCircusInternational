   Enzo has its own definition of illusion:
"An art capable of pushing the limits of the imagination."
So here is the challenge he notes with this show: "It's important for me that the audience just did not witness a spectacle of illusion or a traditional magic show. I will make them live an experience where their emotions are put to the test! I want to disrupt, question, wonder ... ".:<br />
     "I revisit the illusion of the woman cut in two to be totally different from what we have seen before. In my version, the woman will be cut vertically and symmetrically. "" In the issue of Equilibrium, I present the first illusion in which I drew the plans; it is a kind of giant construction game where the elements are stacked in an impossible balance that supports me to 5 meters above the ground on the tip of my heel. "

"I launched the challenge show inside the Casino de Paris a real helicopter with a wingspan close to the size of the stage! "" But the highlight of the show and the big news in this show is my time travel. I am about to attempt a unique experience that will make me travel through time and upset the space-time framework. Defying the laws of physics, this tour will be achieved using Tesla coils me "transmit" over 12 million volts to allow me to cross the space-time. This machine will generate a magnetic field of such power that some viewers will have to leave the room: pregnant women, holders of hearing aids or pacemakers ... Getting around in an instant in space or time was a challenge that j 'have long worked. Today I am able to prove that he is no longer a simple idea on a map but the result is real. "
The border of illusion is exceeded. These experiences will remain forever ingrained in the public mind. Ant challenge in time, space and matter, Enzo challenges the laws of physics, but above all our certainties? But can we get away with playing with the order of things? And if these experiments were not mere illusions?
